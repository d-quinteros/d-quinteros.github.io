								<h3 class="major">Summary Overview</h3>
								<p>For our half semester long project in PIE class, we have been working on creating an analog synthesizer controlled by a two-octave wooden keyboard. This synthesizer produces sound and also controls a mechanical display that adds a visually interesting element to the project.
The mechanical display is made up of 24 concentric rings of mirrored acrylic that oscillate up and down, starting at the most central ring and moving outward. This creates the effect of a ripple, similar to the one caused by a water droplet. The speed of the rings is controlled by the frequency of the note being played on the synthesizer, so a higher note results in faster ripples. The rings are moved by 12 servo motors, each attached to its own cam shaft.
The analog synthesizer itself is a two octave system made up of a hysteretic oscillator with potentiometers, which are used to tune the pitch of each key on the keyboard. These components work together to produce sound, and the user can tune the sound by adjusting the potentiometers.
Overall, our project combines both sound and visual elements to create an interactive and engaging experience. The user can play notes on the wooden keyboard and watch as the mechanical display responds to the frequency of the notes being played. The combination of the synthesizer and the mechanical display allows for a unique and dynamic experience that is not possible with just one of these elements alone.

									<figcaption><cap_text>Figure 1: Hysteretic oscillator schematic</cap_text></figcaption>
								</figure>
								
								<p>Our goal for the hysteretic oscillator was to tune it to 1 Hz and then put potentiometers in parallel attached to switches as a substitute to the resistor in the RC values. We knew there was 12-V coming from the power connection. This was all we needed to calculate the component values to produce an oscillating square wave with the desired frequencies. We first wanted a duty cycle of .5 or 50% for the hysteretic oscillator because it would make the rest of the calculations and simulations less complicated. The duty cycle of the oscillation depends on the difference between the reference voltage and power voltage to the op-amp.</p>
								
								<figure>
									<img src="images/duty_figure.png" width="480" height="" alt="" style="width:50%;"/>
									<figcaption><cap_text>Figure 2: Illustrates the relationship between the reference voltage and the duty cycle of the oscillations. Each line represents a different $\alpha$ value where, $\alpha  = \frac{R_{2}}{(R_{1} + R_{2})}$. At $V_{ref} = \frac{1}{2}V_{dd}$, the duty cycle is at 50\%. Also at this point, the value of $\alpha$ does not have any effect on the duty cycle.</cap_text></figcaption>
								</figure>

								<p>The equation for the duty cycle for a hysteretic oscillator is,</p>
								<p>\begin{equation}D = \frac{ln\frac{V_{dd} - \alpha V_{ref}}{\alpha(V_{dd}-V_{ref})}}{ln\frac{V_{dd}-\alpha(V_{dd}-V_{ref})}{\alpha(V_{dd}-V_{ref})}\frac{V_{dd}-\alpha V{ref}}{\alpha(V_{ref})}}, </p>
								<p>which we used to check the duty cycle output of our values. After plugging our values into the equation it became,</p>	
								<p>\begin{equation} D = \frac{ln\frac{12 - \alpha (6)}{\alpha(6)}}{ln(\frac{12-\alpha (6)}{\alpha(6)})^2},\end{equation} </p>
								<p>which demonstrates why the value of $\alpha$ has no effect on the duty cycle when $V_{ref} = \frac{1}{2}V_{dd}$. </p>
								<p>The next calculations were made for the values of the components that changed the period of the oscillator. We used the $0.1\mu F$ capacitor in the low-pass filter because this was a reasonable value we had access to. Since the time constant ($\tau$) of the filter is $RC$, we needed a larger resistor value to compensate for the low capacitor value. This is because when the $\tau$ value is low you need a lower $\alpha$, but there are limits to the size of $\alpha$.</p>	
								
								<figure>
									<img src="images/alpha_figure.png" width="480" height="" alt="" style="width:50%;"/>
									<figcaption><cap_text>Figure 3: This graph demonstrates at $V_{ref} = \frac{1}{2}V_{dd}$ lowering the $\alpha$ value lowers the $\tau$ needed for the same period. This means at the higher $\tau$ values, you are allowed to use larger $\alpha$ values, but as the $\tau$ gets smaller you need a lower $\alpha$ value.</cap_text></figcaption>
								</figure>
								
								<p>In order to get those smaller $\alpha$ values you need bigger resistor values and it appeared like the needed resistor values were much larger than the ones we had quick access to, so based on that we knew we wanted the $\tau$ value to be as big as possible. With the $RC$ values for $\tau$ figured out, we can solve for $\alpha$ using the hysteretic oscillator period equation,</p>
								<p>\begin{equation}T = \tau ln\frac{V_{dd}-\alpha(V_{dd}-V_{ref})}{\alpha(V_{dd}-V_{ref})}\frac{V_{dd}-\alpha V_{ref}}{\alpha V_{ref}}.\end{equation}</p>
								<p>The equation is then,</p>
								<p>\begin{equation}1 = .0000001*2000000* ln\frac{12-\alpha(6)}{\alpha(6)}\frac{12-\alpha (6)}{\alpha (6)},\end{equation}</p>
								<p>when the known values are inserted into variables. we used graphing tools to find the value of $\alpha$ for the resistor values we would use in $\tau$,</p>
								<p>We rearranged $\alpha  = \frac{R_{2}}{(R_{1} + R_{2})}$ to isolate $R_{1}$ on one side of the equation. Thus, the equation became,<p>
								<p>\begin{equation}R_{1} = \frac{R_{2} - \alpha R_{2}}{\alpha}.\end{equation}</p>
								<p>We used Excel to compute the $R_{1}$ values by plugging every resistor value available to use for this project into $R_{2}$. We also used Excel to visually compare the outputs of $R_{1}$ values to real resistor values that were provided in this project. We had a column that would find the nearest real resistor value from the calculated $R_{1}$ values and calculated the error $\%$ between them. The equation for the error was,</p>
								<p>\begin{equation}Error \% = \frac{R1_{Real}-R1_{Calculated}}{R1_{Real}} * 100\end{equation}</p>
								<p>The lowest error percentage we calculated was .8\% with $R_{1}$ being $80.6\Omega$ and $R_{2}$ being $14.3\Omega$. We did these calculations with the resistors we had access to. This error works for the equivalent ratio with the larger resistor values, such as, $80.6k\Omega$ and $14.3k\Omega$ There were a few other low percentages, but no other combination of resistor values produced an error percent close to this. </p>
								<p>The next values we calculated were the resistors for the voltage divider to make the input of the hysteretic oscillator exactly $\frac{1}{2}V_{dd}$. We wanted the resistor values to be as low as possible, but since the resistors are rated for lower power ratings we needed resistors large enough to drop the power to less than their power ratings. We used $1K\Omega$ resistors to drop the current. </p>
								<p>The calculations we made for all the components would create the following waveform,</p>
								
								<figure>
									<img src="images/Single_period.png" width="480" height="" alt="" style="width:50%;"/>
									<figcaption><cap_text>Figure 4: This is a single waveform created from the hysteretic oscillator. This particular waveform was the ideal simulation with no error accounted for except from the calculations made for the components. It is key to note the period is nearly 1 second and the characteristics of the waveform are similar to those expected. The voltage goes between the rails of the op-amp, which are at 3.3-V and 0-V. The duty cycle is also clearly seen as .5 or 50\%</cap_text></figcaption>

								<p>During the second sprint, we worked on a new voltage controlled oscillator to allow for future improvements in the project. This included research into parts for power, an exponential converter (NPN transistor based), and an oscillator for sawtooth, triangle, and square. We started learning about how analog VCO’s work and we found the overall designs are consistent throughout the circuits. For this sprint, we wanted to get a design we found online working before we designed our own. We designed the circuit in simulation, but we were running into issues with the integrator in LTspice, but we did eventually get the issues resolved.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Ripple Display</h3>
								<p>The greatest challenge we faced was scoping the final product. With the ideal system being capable of presenting itself with the grandeur of a mechanical art piece emulating the unfathomable beauty and complexity of a ubiquitous event. We initially designed a display with 60 concentric rings encased within a 2 foot diameter housing which would contain all of the electrical components and hopefully muffle any unwanted noise that would distract the listener from the analog synthesizer. As the project moved forward, we began to blend our imitation  with the promise of greater flexibility for the sake of visual appeal. This resulted in a system that required 4 sets of 16 servos each responsible for a quarter of a ring, as well as the ring directly above and below through a 1:1 gear ratio positioned slightly offset with to one another in order to smoothen out the wave and simulate 60 rings while only comprising of 20 independently controlled rings. Issues began to arise when the cost of this large scale system came into play. Although possible, 64 servos would have been the entirety of our budget while still requiring an adequate power supply along with the necessary number of Arduinos to control them. During the final sprint of our project it was decided that for simplicity's sake we would limit ourselves to 12 servos and have them each responsible for controlling one camshaft that would evenly raise two Delrin rails up and down. The mirrored acrylic rings would be connected to these rails and allow for the undulating motion to be displayed resembling rippling water. The final product was an icositetrahedron prism two feet in diameter and over one and a half feet in height. The lids and outer walls, which were responsible for positioning the servos, the shafts, and the rails, were made up of quarter inch thick plywood that was laser cut to specifications. In addition to being structurally sound, the aspect of symmetry was incorporated into all of the design elements in order to maintain a unique but simple aesthetic while allowing for a high degree of versatility with the final fabrication process. The cam shaft rails were laser cut out of Delrin in order to prevent the warping and flexing prevalent in woods and acrylics. Cams were 3d printed and the shafts upon which they were mounted were made of threaded, quarter inch, galvanized steel, for rigidity and lack of linear deviation (straightness).</p>

								<h3 class="major">Analog Synthesizer</h3>
								<p>Our first iteration of the piano was a single octave that was made up of 3D printed keys and a laser cut yuca board frame. This first iteration proved that the wiring was possible as well as the basic design. It also illuminated that we were going to have a problem with friction between the piano keys as well as perfecting the springs as the keys were too hard to press down in this iteration.</p>
								<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jmTknJDjco0">Synth Video</a></p>
								
								<h3 class="major">Rings</h3>
								<p>For the initial design we decided to scale down the product in order to decrease the manufacturing time and prove the functionality of our idea. The structural panels were made out of clear acrylic in order to allow for maximum visibility of the working components from all angles. The system, which was built to create the ring undulations, consisted of six herringbone gears, each with an extruded cylinder towards the edge in order to act within a scotch yoke system in order to raise and lower the rings in time with one another. The 3d printed herringbone gears were specifically chosen to line up the z axis of all the wooden dowel cam shafts while in motion. The reason for this was that at the time we had mounted the gears to metal bolts that slid into nylon bearings within the structural panels, and while the system ran, ordinary gears would shift and drop the camshafts. The design functioned with two modes, one with the geared cams to display the scalability of the design, and a smooth version to display how the individually controlled rings would undulate.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Analog Synthesizer</h3>
								<p>While mostly focusing on the next iteration for the rings, we finalized the design for the final keyboard. We decided to use wood for both aesthetics as well as reducing inter-key friction. We also decided to move from a class two lever system to a class three lever system so that we could utilize the springs we had access to while also reducing the necessary force to play a note with a key press.</p>
								<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jmTknJDjco0">Synth Video</a></p>
								
								<h3 class="major">Rings</h3>
								<p>From the first sprint we had learned a great deal about the frictional forces present between wood and nylon, along with those found between gears. The slightest variation in opposing cam angles would cause the cam shafts to lock up and damage the system. In this second iteration we also planned to create the basis for the modular idea upon which the final product stood. The plan was to create a one set of walls that would lift one ring, and have them be attached to another set that lifts a concentric ring directly above the first. This plan allowed us to not have to worry about using a large number of resources only to pivot in a direction that would result in the waste of those said resources. We had removed the idea of gears to increase ring count and the cam shafts had been switched to Delrin by this point; these two changes eliminated the catching that would occur during cam rotations. The visual aspect however was nowhere near up to par and required a great deal of redesign to be used for the final product.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Rings</h3>
								<p>For the last sprint we created the panel design that would encompass the shaft system and decided upon creating a lid with enough holes to provide back up slots in case a set of holes didn’t cut properly. The product was made to be full scale and created the desired impression of grandeur. The only issues we found were that the Delrin rails would slip off their cams and they would change angles and get stuck much more easily than in the last design. This one lacking the nylon bearings due to the thicker rail choice caused us to rethink our lid.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Addtions Before Demo</h3>
								<p>In order to make a functioning product for demo day 3d printed plates were added below the rails to allow for more contact area and decreased risk of cam slippage. The top plate was now assisted with a second raised plate to prevent any unwanted movement.</p>
